Traumatic brain injury analysis in humans is exceedingly difficult due to the intrusive methods by which data can be collected; thus, many researchers commonly implement animal surrogates. However, ethical concerns and cost limit the scope of these tests on animal subjects too. Computational models, which provide an alternative method to data collection, are not constrained by these concerns and are able to generate significant amounts of data in relatively short time. This paper shows how the data generated from models of a human and pig head can be used towards developing interspecies correspondence rules for blast overpressure effects. The blast overpressure is simulated using an explosive of known weight and standoff distance and injury is evaluated using criteria in published literature. Results indicate that equivalent blasts in the human and pig produce significantly different injuries, and when equating total injured brain volume, the locations of injury in the brain vary between the species. Charge weight and total injured brain volume are related using a linear regression of the data such that a known injury in the pig or known blast can be used to predict injury or the blast experienced by a human, thus creating a correspondence between the species.
