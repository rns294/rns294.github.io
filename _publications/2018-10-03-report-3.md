This report elucidates current challenges in development of predictive high-fidelity human head models for traumatic brain injury. Various developmental stages of the NRL high-fidelity head model, are used to describe the challenges encountered and how they can be overcome. Semi-automatic segmentation procedures, meshing to balance fidelity and cost of computation, realistic boundary and contact conditions, accurate component constitutive models based on published data, and validation with experimental output from PMHS subjects are explained. The elucidation of specific and overarching challenges are expected to enable appreciation and creation of better computational models.
