The central goal of this chapter is to present an outline of the plan and current status of an effort to connect Additive Manufacturing (AM) process parameters with parameters describing the functional performance of produced parts. The term “functional performance” here represents primarily mechanical or thermal or electrochemical performance. The described effort represents an overview of the main research activities within a new multi-year grand-challenge project initiated at the US Naval Research Laboratory (US-NRL) in late 2016, in collaboration with groups from various academic institutions.
