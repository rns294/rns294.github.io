Computational modeling, of both humans and animals, has gained momentum for the investigation of traumatic brain injury. These models require both accurate geometric descriptions and a calibrated constitutive model to predict material behavior. The first step in model calibration involves selecting a model form that captures the available experiment data. Model parameters are estimated for each identified material system via optimization by minimizing the error between model predictions and experimental data. This report details model calibration for all materials identified in models of a human head and porcine headupper torso. The result is a modeling framework and reference tables for future model developers.
