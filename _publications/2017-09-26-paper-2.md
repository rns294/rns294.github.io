Shape memory alloy actuators deliver high forces while being compact and reliable, making them ideal for consideration in aerospace applications. Induction heating of shape memory alloy actuators, specifically tubes that twist about the longitudinal axis, has recently been studied experimentally and computationally using finite element analysis. Reduced-order models for the torsional behavior of shape memory alloy tubes and induction heating of general metallic tubes exist, and thus, it is possible for these thermal and mechanical models to be combined and numerically solved. This work develops and implements an engineering model for inductively heated shape memory alloy tubes based on the reduction of the governing partial differential equations in space and time to an ordinary differential equation in time. An example solution is compared to finite element analysis results and agrees well. Finally, the ordinary differential equation is linearized and solved analytically. The linearized model agrees well with the nonlinear ordinary differential equation and finite element model.
