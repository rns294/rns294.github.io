I am currently a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Labortory (NRL) in Washington, D.C., working on a variety of projects involving mechanics of materials and machine learning.

His research interests primarily include additive manufacturing of metals and ceramics, biomechanics of brain injury, and applications of machine learning in mechanics and materials.

Prior Experience
------
Before joining NRL, I was a biomechanics engineer for Leidos Inc. where I worked to develop stratgeties to protect Warfighters from injuries due to blunt/blast events and methodologies to assess combat helmet effectiveness. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at Texas A&amp;M University working on smart material analysis and integration into aerospace systems.

Education
------
I hold a B.S. in aerospace engineering from Virginia Tech, an M.S. in aerospace engineering from Texas A&amp;M University, and a Ph.D. in industrial and systems engineering from Texas A&amp;M University. Additionally, I have a graduate certificate in applied statistics from Texas A&amp;M University with course emphasis on Bayesian and spatial statistics.
