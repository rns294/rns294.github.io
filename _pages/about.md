I am currently a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Labortory (NRL) in Washington, D.C., working on a variety of projects involving mechanics of materials and machine learning.

I am seeking opportunities to develop and lead projects, as well as personnel, in research and engineering.

My research interests primarily include: Warfighter protection, additive manufacturing of metals and ceramics, biomechanics of brain injury, and applications of machine learning in those areas and for other engineering/research problems.

Prior Experience
------
Before joining NRL, I was a biomechanics engineer for Leidos Inc. where I worked to develop stratgeties to protect Warfighters from injuries due to blunt/blast events and methodologies to assess combat helmet effectiveness. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at Texas A&amp;M University working on smart material analysis and integration into aerospace systems. I have also been involved in private consulting work to analyze biomedical devices made of shape memory alloys.

Education
------
I hold a B.S. in aerospace engineering from Virginia Tech, an M.S. in aerospace engineering from Texas A&amp;M University, and a Ph.D. in industrial and systems engineering from Texas A&amp;M University. Additionally, I have a graduate certificate in applied statistics from Texas A&amp;M University with course emphasis on Bayesian and spatial statistics.
