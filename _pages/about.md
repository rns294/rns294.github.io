I am currently the deputy Chief Engineer in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Systems Acquisition Directorate at the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), where I lead ...

I maintain an active TS/SCI clearance with CI polygraph. 

Prior Experience
------
Before joining NRO, I was a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) working on research projects involving Warfighter protection, metal/ceramic additive manufacturing, injury biomechanics, and applications of machine learning in those areas. I have additional experience as a biomechanics engineer for Leidos Inc. where I worked to develop strategies to protect Warfighters from injuries due to blunt/blast events and methodologies to assess combat helmet effectiveness. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at Texas A&amp;M University working on smart material analysis and integration into aerospace systems. I have also been involved in private consulting work to analyze biomedical devices made of shape memory alloys.

Education
------
I hold a B.S. in aerospace engineering from Virginia Tech, an M.S. in aerospace engineering from Texas A&amp;M University, and a Ph.D. in industrial engineering from Texas A&amp;M University. Additionally, I have a graduate certificate in applied statistics from Texas A&amp;M University with emphasis on Bayesian and spatial statistics.
