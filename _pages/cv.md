  * Provided critical insight and guidance using subject matter expertise in metal additive manufacturing (AM) and machine learning (ML).
  * Created an ML-based model for the AM process – leading to a 50% improvement in the performance and quality of AM parts while significantly reducing material waste costs.
  * Co-principal investigator for multiple DoD programs in AM and traumatic brain injury (TBI), involving Tri-Service participation, with total funding exceeding $30 million.
  * Authored technical briefs for senior leaders, subject matter experts, program managers, and non-technical audiences on complex scientific topics.

* Biomechanics Engineer, Leidos Inc., 2015-2016
  * Developed comprehensive strategies to analyze blast injuries sustained during weapons training and combat, resulting in enhanced protection for Warfighters.
  * Identified TBI relationships between various animal species and humans to improve diagnosis and treatment of TBI in Warfighters.
  * Created image-based finite element models of humans and other species using medical imaging data for realistic simulations and accurate TBI assessments.
  * Established a method to evaluate combat helmets against over 300k potential ballistic threats and performed statistical analysis to identify areas lacking protection.
  * Implemented a material model calibration framework for biological materials to enhance the prediction accuracy of material properties by up to 60%.  

* Research Associate, Texas A&amp;M University, 2013-2015
  * Development of a modelling framework for inductive heating of shape memory alloy components to achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in actuation rates.
