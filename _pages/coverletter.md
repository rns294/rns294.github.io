A PDF version of my CV is available [here](http://rns294.github.io/files/Robert_Saunders_CV.pdf) and a cover letter is available [here](http://rns294.github.io/files/Cover_Letter.pdf).

I am seeking opportunities as a senior level scientist/engineer where I can leverage by technical abilities and expertise to enhance the safety of our Nation. I am interested in positions that will allow me to utilize my skills in project management, technical analysis, and research and development. Ideally, this role would offer the ability for me to develop as a leader for both personnel and projects while continuing to grow as a technical expert.

I am currently a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., working on a variety of projects involving mechanics of materials and machine learning. My current research interests primarily include: Warfighter protection, metal/ceramic additive manufacturing, injury biomechanics, and applications of machine learning in those areas. However, my interests extend beyond these to any mission which supports U.S. national security and benefit our Soldiers and civilians.

I hold degrees in aerospace engineering (B.S., M.S.) and industrial engineering (Ph.D.) along with a graduate certificate in applied statistics. In each degree as well as in my professional career, I have been successful in quickly adapting to and overcoming new challenges with limited direction. In numerous instances, I have begun a project without prior experience in a necessary area and each time, I have been able to successfully deliver a final product/report by leveraging resources available to me and collaborating with subject matter experts. My success in these projects is fundamentally derived from my personality as a self-starter and my desire to achieve expertise in any mission I undertake. These traits, combined with my exceptional work ethic, mean that I can adapt to and work in novel fast-paced environments with ease, including working on multiple projects at once. These traits have been exemplified in my career where I am expected to work on 3-4 projects at any given time and I was able to complete a PhD while working full-time.

I have developed expertise in fields ranging from spacecraft dynamics and electromagnetics to biomechanics and machine learning. However, to me, my most valuable skill is my ability to effectively transform complex, abstract requirements into tangible objectives with concrete deadlines regardless of specific application or field. As I have grown professionally, I have naturally taken on more responsibilities including developing project proposals, communicating findings to senior leaders and other subject matter experts, and leading components of large projects, which includes mentoring younger engineers/scientists and supporting senior staff as needed. 

I have found through these experiences that leading projects and staff are passions of mine, and I am seeking opportunities where I am able to explore these areas further, including continued education via an MBA and/or PMP (or similar) certification. An ideal position would allow me the flexibility to craft new proposals that address critical issues, execute them through collaborations with multidisciplinary teams, mentor and develop new talent, and grow into a senior leadership position.
