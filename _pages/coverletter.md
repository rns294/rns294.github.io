A PDF version of my cover letter is available [here](http://rns294.github.io/files/Cover_Letter.pdf).

My mission is to become a DoD/IC leader in development and transitioning of advanced capabilities across the technology development “valley of death”. I aim to transition these capabilities to support the Warfighter and inform policymakers, maintain the US’s battlespace advantage, and inspire/mentor the next generation of engineers and scientists. I am seeking opportunities as a senior manager/director (GS-14/15 equivalent) with responsibilities such as leading and managing personnel and programs, oversight of strategic directions and technology development, and/or management and integration of risk, requirements, and resources.

I am currently a deputy branch chief in the Office of Space Launch (OSL), Launch Management Division at the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), where I lead strategic development and transitioning of launch and on-orbit capabilities. In this role, I also lead a team of military, civilian, and contractor personnel to deliver future launch solutions and offer flexible/tailorable launch support services. Prior to joining NRO, I was a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) working on research projects involving Warfighter protection, metal/ceramic additive manufacturing, injury biomechanics, and applications of machine learning in those areas. While I have developed expertise in the listed areas, my interests extend beyond these to any mission which supports U.S. national security and benefit our Soldiers and civilians.

I hold degrees in aerospace engineering (B.S., M.S.) and industrial engineering (Ph.D.) along with a graduate certificate in applied statistics. In each degree as well as in my professional career, I have been successful in quickly adapting to and overcoming new challenges with limited direction. In numerous instances, I have begun a project without prior experience in a necessary area and each time, I have been able to successfully deliver a final product/report by leveraging resources available to me and collaborating with subject matter experts. My success in these projects is fundamentally derived from my personality as a self-starter and my desire to achieve expertise in any mission I undertake. These traits, combined with my exceptional work ethic, mean that I can adapt to and work in novel fast-paced environments with ease, including working on multiple projects at once and leading diverse teams. 

I have developed expertise in fields ranging from biomechanics and electromagnetics to machine learning and acquisitions. However, to me, my most valuable skill is my ability to effectively transform complex, abstract requirements into tangible objectives with concrete deadlines regardless of specific application or field. As I have grown professionally, I have naturally taken on more responsibilities including developing project proposals, communicating findings to senior leaders and other subject matter experts, and leading projects and teams of varying experience, which includes mentoring younger engineers/scientists and supporting senior staff as needed. 

I have found through my experiences that leading projects and staff to accomplish high level objectives are passions of mine, and I am seeking opportunities where I am able to grow and develop as a senior leader in the DoD/IC communities, including leading a team of teams, continuing my education via formal degrees and certifications, and participating in leadership development activities. An ideal position would allow me the flexibility to craft strategic directions that address critical Warfighter issues, execute those directions through collaborations with multidisciplinary teams, mentor and develop new talent, and grow into an executive level position.
